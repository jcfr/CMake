FindVcvars-module
-----------------

* A new :module:`FindVcvars` module has been added to support
  :command:`find_package(Vcvars)` calls and set `Vcvars_BATCH_FILE`
  and `Vcvars_WRAPPER_BATCH_FILE` variables allowing to easily execute
  commands with the Visual Studio environment being used if it applies.
